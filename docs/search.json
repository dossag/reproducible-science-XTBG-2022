The purpose of this workshop is to get participants\r\nfamiliar with the concept of reproducible\r\nscience that is surprisingly not commonly taught but which\r\nis becoming a requirement for better collaboration (not only with others\r\nbut with oneself through time) and for credible science. At the end of\r\nthis workshop, attendees should be familiar with tools use to achieve\r\nreproducible science, will be more confident with themselves, and be\r\ninclined to adopt these tools which will ease their collaboration with\r\nthemselves as well as others. This course consists of four main parts\r\nwhich aim to putting everything from data to final report including r\r\ncode and some interpretations and also exercises as step by step work me\r\nthrough method. This course will be mainly taught by Dossa G.G.O. click here to email me. Dossa\r\nteaches this section yearly at the postgraduate Advanced Fieldcourse in\r\nEcology and Conservation – XTBG AFEC-X for the past two\r\nyears.\r\nWho should attend this course?\r\nAnyone who carries out research either as student, or research staff\r\nand seeks guidance to manage data efficiently, to improve peers\r\ncredibility in their research output, and is keen to make science solid\r\nand credible. Consider thinking about the following questions:\r\nHave you ever worked collaboratively with others, and received\r\nmultiple comments that you needed to deal with?\r\nHave you been ever asked by your collaborators/supervisor to go back\r\nto previous version of your manuscripts/analysis/ results?\r\nHave you ever thought that you finalized an analysis but to realize\r\na mistake was in the data file?\r\nHave you ever spent endless time to explain your past / current\r\nprojects to your collaborators (including yourself) but realize you even\r\ndo not remember what you did at some point or why you did certain\r\nthings?\r\nHave you ever copied a table from R/SPSS/Minitab/SAS to excel, and\r\nsubsequently from Excel to your word processing document? And most\r\nannoyingly, you need to repeat these steps whenever anything has changed\r\nin the analysis or code.\r\nTimeline\r\nModule 1: Motivations and intro [Module1]]\r\nModule 2: Bridging the gap among actors| video] [Module2 |\r\nvideo]\r\nModule 3: Dealing with data analysis in the tidyverse\r\n[Module3 | Exercise | solutions | video]\r\nModule 4: Dealing with data analysis in the tidyverse\r\nusing ggplot2 [Module4 | Exercise | solutions | video]\r\nModule 5: Literate statistical programming: knitr [Module5 | Exercise | solutions\r\n| video]\r\nModule 6: R Markdown [Module6 | practical | solutions | video]\r\nModule 7: Version control Git and Github [Module7 |\r\npractical | solutions | video]\r\nModule 8: Extra class on git and Github [Module7_extra | practical | solutions\r\n| video]\r\nModule 9: R project [Module | practical | video]\r\nModule 10: Reproducible: Good enough workflow [Module\r\n| video]\r\nModule 11: Extras (Writing article in R markdown, Quarto (If time\r\npermits)) [Module | video]\r\nRequirements\r\nAttendees are required to install the following software\r\nbeforehand\r\n1- Git\r\n2- Create a Github account on\r\n3- Download a Github\r\ndesktop\r\n4- Download and install\r\nR\r\n5- Download\r\nRStudio\r\n6- Have Git, GitHub and RStudio talk to each other following these\r\nguidelines (section 2.2.2 Configuration only).\r\n7- Install the following R packages:\r\ntidyverse, sf, emo,\r\njanitor, palmerpenguins, usethis\r\nand lubridate.
