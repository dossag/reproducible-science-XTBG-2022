## Context

We will use the awesome `palmerpenguins` dataset `r emo::ji("penguin")`, an alternative to Fisher's `iris` dataset, to explore and visualize data.

These data have been collected and shared by [Dr. Kristen Gorman](https://www.uaf.edu/cfos/people/faculty/detail/kristen-gorman.php) and [Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER](https://pal.lternet.edu/). 

The package was built by Drs Allison Horst and Alison Hill, check out the [official website](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/). 

The package `palmerpenguins` has two datasets. 

```{r showdata}
library(palmerpenguins)
data(package = 'palmerpenguins')
``` 

---

The dataset `penguins` is a simplified version of the raw data; see `?penguins` for more info: 

.tiny-font[
```{r example-penguins}
head(penguins)
```
]

---

The other dataset `penguins_raw` has the raw data; see `?penguins_raw` for more info: 

.tiny-font[
```{r example-penguins-raw}
head(penguins_raw)
```
]

For this exercise, we're gonna use the `penguins` dataset.

## Question 1

* Create a new R Markdown document, name it and save it.   

* Delete everything after line 12.   

* Add a new section title, simple text and text in bold font.   
  
* Compile ("Knit").    


---

## Question 2


* Add a chunk in which you load the `palmerpenguins`. The corresponding line of code should be hidden in the output.    

* Load also the `tidyverse` suite of packages.   

* Modify the defaults to suppress all messages.   


---

## Question 3

* Add another chunk in which you build a table with the 10 first rows of the dataset.    


---

## Question 4

* In a new section, display how many individuals, penguins species and islands we have in the dataset. This info should appear directly in the text, you might want to use inline code `r emo::ji("smile")`.    

* Calculate the mean of the (numeric) traits measured on the penguins.    

---

## Question 5

* In another section, entitled 'Graphical exploration', build a figure with 3 superimposed histograms, each one corresponding to the body mass of a species.    

---

## Question 6

* Install package `citr` to manage citations following the guidelines [here](https://github.com/crsh/citr). If everything goes well, you should see it in the pulldown menu `Addins` `r emo::ji("muscle")`.   

* Pick a recent publication from the researcher who shared the data, Dr Kristen Gorman. Import this publication in your favorite references manager (we use Zotero, no hard feeling), and create a bibtex reference that you will add to to the file `mabiblio.bib`.   

* Add `bibliography: mabiblio.bib` at the beginning of your R Markdown document (YAML).   

* Cite the reference iin the text using `Insert citations` in the pull-down menu `Addins`.   

* Compile.   

---

## Question 7

* Change the default citation format (Chicago style) into the The American Naturalist format. It can be found here  <https://www.zotero.org/styles>. To do so, add `csl: the-american-naturalist.csl` in the YAML.   

---

## Question 8

* Build your report in html, pdf and docx format. `r emo::ji("tada")`
