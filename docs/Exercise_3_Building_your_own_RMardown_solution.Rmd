In this current exercise, you are asked:

1. Please give "My first R Markdown document" as your document title, construct your first R markdown document that reproduces exactly the formatting of the workshop introduction first paragraph document at [click here](https://dossag.github.io/reproducible-science-afec-x-2021/) by replacing Dossa's information by your own (e.g., replace **Dossa** by **your_name**). Make sure you put in italic what should be in italic and in bold what you should be in bold;

2. Give first level heading "Photos":

    2.1. Give second level heading ("My institute logo: full size"), download the logo of your current institute and add it in your R markdown document as a big size ;

    2.2. Give second level heading ("My institute logo: small size), repeat the previous question but by this time reducing the size of the photo output;

    2.3. Give second level heading ("My personal photo") to add a photo of yourself but here add a caption as follows (Figure 3: Photo of "your_name");

3. Give first level heading ("Tables")

    3.2. Add an inline code that renders the mean height of all persons included in your table;

    3.3. Give second level heading ("Table with RMarkdown generator"), include the same table as above but by using [RMarkdown table generator]();
[Please put the content of the table in **right alignment**]

4. Give first level heading ("Reading paper")

Add the quote you have from your article in italic and write  the last sentence. "Now, i am close to adopt reproducibility and I am proud of myself" 

6. to knitr your document to get a ***html*** document.


7. Save the html as "your_name_exo3.html"and share on our wechat group.


***Answers***

# **Q1: see the yaml part**

# **Q2: Photos**
## **Q2.1:My institute logo: full size**

First make sure you downloaded your institute logo and save in the same directory as your rmarkdown document. Then, include the photo.

### **Logo in full size**

![xtbg logo](xtbg_logo.png)

### **My institute logo: small size**

For adding small size logo, you need not to reduce the size by hand in another software but just use the following syntax.

```{r, echo=FALSE,out.width='20%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='Small size of xtbg logo', include=TRUE, results="hold"}
knitr::include_graphics('xtbg_logo.png')
```

### **Personal photo**
```{r, echo=FALSE,out.width='50%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='Figure 3: Photo of Dossa', include=TRUE, results="hold"}
knitr::include_graphics('Dossa_Photo_for_website.JPG')
```



# **Q3: Tables**

## **Table by hand**

Use := for left-aligned, :=: for centered, =: for right-aligned columns.

(==) to separate the first row to the other
(--) to separate other rows

Left alignment (:=)

+--------+------+------------+-------------+
|Names   |Sex   |Education   |Height (m)   |
+:=======+:=====+:===========+:============+ 
|Dossa   |M     |Ph.D.       |1.86         |
+--------+------+------------+-------------+
|Rhett   |M     |Ph.D.       |1.82         |
+--------+------+------------+-------------+
|CaoKF   |M     |Ph.D.       |1.65         |
+--------+------+------------+-------------+

Right alignment (=:)

+--------+------+------------+-------------+
|Names   |Sex   |Education   |Height (m)   |
+=======:+=====:+============+============:+ 
|Dossa   |M     |Ph.D.       |1.86         |

+--------+------+------------+-------------+
|CaoKF   |M     |Ph.D.       |1.65         |
+--------+------+------------+-------------+

Center alignment (:=:)

+--------+------+------------+-------------+
|Names   |Sex   |Education   |Height (m)   |
+:======:+:====:+:===========+:===========:+ 
|Dossa   |M     |Ph.D.       |1.86         |
+--------+------+------------+-------------+
|Rhett   |M     |Ph.D.       |1.82         |
+--------+------+------------+-------------+
|CaoKF   |M     |Ph.D.       |1.65         |
+--------+------+------------+-------------+

## **Add an inline code for mean height**

The average height of all members  of my group is `r round(mean(c(1.86, 1.82, 1.65)), 3)`



## **Table with RMarkdown table generator**
|Names   |Sex   |Education   |height   |
|---|---|---|---|
|Dossa   |M   |P   |  300 |
|Rhett   |M   | P  |  100 |
|CaoKF   |M   | P  |90   |

[R Markdown table generator](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables)

|Names |Sex   |Education   |Height (cm)  |
|---|---|---|---|
| Dossa  |M   |Ph.D.   |1.86   |
| Rhett  |M   |Ph.D.   |1.82   |
| CaoKF  |M   |Ph.D.   |1.65   |

# **Q4: Reading paper** 

I read an article entitled [**Five selfish reasons to work reproducibly**](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-015-0850-7) by _Markowetz_ 

# **Q5: Conclusion**

Here is a quote from the above article: *"Science is becoming more transparent and reproducible every single day. You can be a leader in this process! A cutting-edge trend-setter! Come on, I know
you want it too."* by Markowetz 2015 Now, i am close to adopt reproducibility and I am proud of myself.
