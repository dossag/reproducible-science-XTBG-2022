# Who are the players?
.left[
- Authors:

    -> Want to make their research reproducible

    -> Want tools for RR to make their lives easier (or at least not much harder)
]

--
.left[
- Readers:

    -> Want to reproduce (and perhaps expand upon) interesting findings

    -> Want tools for RR to make their lives easier

# Existing chalenges
.left[
- Authors must undertake considerable effort to put data/results on the web (may not have resources like a web server);


- Readers must download data/results individually and piece together which data go with which code sections, etc.;


- Readers may not have the same resources as authors;


- Few tools to help authors/readers (although toolbox is growing!).

# Responses to challenges: in reality

.left[
- Authors

      -> Just put stuff on the web

      -> (Infamous) Journal supplementary materials

      -> There are some central databases for various fields (e.g. biology, ICPSR)
]

.left[
- Readers

      -> Just download the data and (try to) figure it out

      -> Piece together the software and run it

# Literate (statistical) programming

.left[

- An article is a stream of text and code;

- Analysis code is divided into text and code chunks;

- Each code chunk loads data and computes results.
]
--

.left[

- Presentation code formats results (tables, figures, etc.);

- Article text explains what is going on;

- Literate programs can be weaved to produce human-readable documents and tangled to produce machine-readable documents.

# Literate (statistical) programming 2

.left[
Literate programming is a general concept that requires:

- A documentation language (human readable);

- A programming language (machine readable):
    1. Sweave uses L<sup>A</sup>T<sup>E</sup>X and R as the documentation and programming languages

    2. Sweave was developed by Friedrich Leisch (member of the R Core) and is maintained by R core

[Sweave's main web site](http://www.statistik.lmu.de/~leisch/Sweave).

# Sweave Limitations

.left[
Sweave has many limitations:


- Focused primarily on LaTeX language, a difficult to learn markup language used only by weirdos;

- Lacks features like caching, multiple plots per chunk, mixing programming languages and many other technical items;

- Not frequently updated or very actively developed.

.left[So is there any alternative to Sweave?

# Alternative to Sweave: knitr

.left[
- Yes, there is knitr is an alternative (more recent) package to Sweave developed by [**Yihui Xie**](https://yihui.org/en/about/);

- Brings together many features added on to Sweave to address limitations;

- knitr uses R as the programming language and variety of documentation languages LaTeX, Markdown, HTML;

- knitr was developed by Yihui Xie (while a graduate student in statistics at Iowa State);

- See [*knitr*](http://yihui.name/knitr/) for more and in lectures later.

# Summary

.left[
- Reproducible research is important as a minimum standard, particularly for studies that are difficult to replicate;

- Infrastructure is needed for creating and distributing reproducible documents, beyond what is currently available;

- There is a growing number of tools for creating reproducible documents.
